According to Dr Paul Jaffe, 宇宙飞船 工程师 at the US Naval Research Laboratory, the concept is scientifically sound.

"NASA and the US 部门 of Energy did a study in the late 70s that cost $20 million at the time and looked at it in pretty great depth," Dr Jaffe told CNN. "The conclusion at that time was that there was nothing wrong with the physics but the real question is the economics."

The 成本 lies in the 编号 of space launches required to build the power-transmitting satellite. With costs as high as $40,000 per kilogram for some space launches, the final price-tag for the first space-based solar power station could be as high as $20 billion.
