Douglas Guthrie distinguishes between guanxi and guanxixue (关系学, the 'art' or 'knowledge' of guanxi), as the former is considered in the modern Chinese society as common inter-personal ties that reflect the Chinese nature, while the latter represents the manipulation and corruption brought about by a selfish and sometimes illegal utilization of guanxi. Although many Chinese lament the strong importance of guanxi in their culture, they still consider guanxi as a Chinese element that should not be denied.
